#### Scenario

Your cybersecurity team has been alerted to suspicious activity on your organization's network. Several employees reported unusual behavior in their browsers after installing what they believed to be a helpful browser extension named "ChatGPT". However, strange things started happening: accounts were being compromised, and sensitive information appeared to be leaking.


#### Machine Environment 

- Windows 10 running in VMware workstation
- Flare Windows Install https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm


### 1.  Which encoding method does the browser extension use to obscure target URLs, making them more difficult to detect during analysis?
---
Lets first examine the provided files for the case.  Knowing it's a Chrome browser extension we should examine the **manifest.json** file.  This file is the central configuration file defining properties and settings for the Chrome extension.

The **background** section defines scripts that runs persistently in the background.  
The **content_scripts** section defines scripts that are run within web pages when the **matches** sub section is matched.

So the loader.js is run persistently in the background while every time a URL is accessed the app.js is injected into the page.  
	
 Looking through app.js there is an obvious function which encodes the payload using a specific method.  CryptoJS.enc.Base64

### 2.  Which website does the extension monitor for data theft, targeting user accounts to steal sensitive information?
---
This block of code within **app.js** targets usernames and passwords within submitted web pages.  We can assume the website is the encoded Base64 string.

The Base64 string can be decoded using CyberChef.

### 3.  Which type of HTML element is utilized by the extension to send stolen data?
---
This function defines the way that data is sent using an HTML element tag

### 4.  What is the first specific condition in the code that triggers the extension to deactivate itself?
---
The first script to get loaded from manifest.json is **loader.js**.  Examining the first lines of code shows a test to determine if the browser is running in a VM.

### 5.  Which event does the extension capture to track user input submitted through forms?
---
This line of JavaScript code is adding an event listener to the **document** object that listens for *submit* events.

### 6.  Which API or method does the extension use to capture and monitor user keystrokes?
---
This code adds an event listener to the **document** object that listen for *keydown* events.

### 7.  What is the domain where the extension transmits the exfiltrated data?
---
The function **sendToServer** contains the domain where the exfiltrated data is sent.

### 8.  Which function in the code is used to exfiltrate user credentials, including the username and password?
---
The name of the function and the code are obvious.

### 9.  Which encryption algorithm is applied to secure the data before sending?
---
The **key** variable is a fixed string converted into UTF-8 encoding.

The **iv* variable is the initialization vector which ensures if the same plaintext key are replayed, the resulting ciphertext with differ.

The **encrypted** variable uses the AES algorithm to encrypt the data using the key and iv.

### 10.  What critical browser API does the extension use to access and manipulate cookies?
---
Since the **manifest.json** contains the â€œcookies" permission, the extension can query and modify chome cookies.
